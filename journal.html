Here is my journal. This is where you will find entries detailing how I have progressed on working on my projects. </p>
<p>Entry 1: <br>
I have enjoyed coding so far, but it has been far from easy for me. I have struggled with expressing my ideas and translating them into code, and there have often been things that I do not know how to do, but I have still had a great time learning regardless.</p>

<p>Entry 2:<br>
So far in CS1, I have learned how to create functioning websites in CSS, and how to incorporate javascript in html files to add interactivity. In javascript, I have learned how to define variables, add event listeners, and run functions, among other things.
</p>
<p>Entry 3: What I've Learned So Far<br>
An event listener is a a piece of code that "listens" for a specific action from the computer (like a click, a mousemove, etc.), and does something when it "hears" that action, like run a function. A variable is placeholder for a specific thing or value. A function run provides an output for whatever is in the input, even if the input is nothing. HTML is the basic language for coding things. Javascript is used to add interactiveness to your HTML files. I am still sort of confused about what CSS is. The terminal is system built into the actual computer, that allows you do command it to do certain things. The console is something in javascript that records your actions on a webpage, and lets you know if ther
<p>Entry 4:<br>
	This week I learned how to animate things using CSS. I made my first animation codesketch of a wolf chasing sheep using what I learned. The next thing I want to learn using animations is how make animations that react to certain event listeners. I am also still trying to figure out how to work on the opacity of my journal background.
</p>Entry 5:<br>
This week I made my first array codesketch. I was able to it change to a random image in my array. I was trying to figure out how to make the image change, and make text accompany the different images, but wasn't quite able to figure that out. I was able to console log which pitch is being thrown, but not able to make the text actually appear, nor the descriptions of the pitches. I'm pretty happy with this codesketch, but I would like to be able to add the descriptions of each pitch.

<p>Entry 6:<br>
This week I worked on a codesketch incorporating for loops. It is not yet complete, but I feel like I understand the concept (somewhat). The way I understand a for loop is that it repeats an action for certain conditions. For example, it might keep making an image until there are 100 copies of it.

<p>Entry 7:<br>
This week I made a for loops codesketch that made 1000 walruses (I think that is the plural of walrus). Why? Who can say? The way I understand the walrus maker to work is that it creates divs with the class of walrus and adds them to the body. It does this for a set interval, which I set to be until the number of walrus divs is no longer > 1000.

<p>Entry 8:<br>
	This week I worked on a mothers' day card codesketch that plays my mom's favorite song when clicked, and pauses when clicked again. I was trying to make it also change the background image when clicked, but for some reason it was not working like usual, so I think I am going to make a lab for this reason, and also to just improve my codesketch in general.

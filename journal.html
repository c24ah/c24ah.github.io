Here is my journal. This is where you will find entries detailing how I have progressed on working on my projects. </p>
<p>Entry 1: <br>
I have enjoyed coding so far, but it has been far from easy for me. I have struggled with expressing my ideas and translating them into code, and there have often been things that I do not know how to do, but I have still had a great time learning regardless.</p>

<p>Entry 2:<br>
So far in CS1, I have learned how to create functioning websites in CSS, and how to incorporate javascript in html files to add interactivity. In javascript, I have learned how to define variables, add event listeners, and run functions, among other things.
</p>
<p>Entry 3: What I've Learned So Far<br>
An event listener is a a piece of code that "listens" for a specific action from the computer (like a click, a mousemove, etc.), and does something when it "hears" that action, like run a function. A variable is placeholder for a specific thing or value. A function run provides an output for whatever is in the input, even if the input is nothing. HTML is the basic language for coding things. Javascript is used to add interactiveness to your HTML files. I am still sort of confused about what CSS is. The terminal is system built into the actual computer, that allows you do command it to do certain things. The console is something in javascript that records your actions on a webpage, and lets you know if there are errors. I am still sort of confused how to make things random in javascript, and about what exactly CSS is.
